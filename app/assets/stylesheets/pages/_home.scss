/* Notes:
- the $type:"upload" tag is required only if you are using a cloudinary-url generator in stylsheet AND if you have uploaded the image using Cloudinary's dashboard (i.e., the non-tech way)
- crop is set to fill since I only want part of an image to be showing (whatever naturally fits into a 400X250), rather than have the entire image scrunched into a 400X250. How does Cloudinary select what of the image goes in the 400X250? That's via a gravity tag; when unspecified, as here, the gravity is auto-set to center (i.e., middle of the image). And you can probably guess, in order for a crop fill to even work, you have to specify a height and width, rather than use an auto tag
- I always make the width a little wider than the screen size min-width, just in case
